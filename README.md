# Solar_System
An interactive script that contains lots of functions that revolve around the solar system.

This was one of the greatest experiences I have had in my short time of coding (about 1 week)
This was an exam or a test for me to see if I was able to create code that I created originally without following a guide and tutorial. 
This was a huge leap in my understanding what it means to code and program.
